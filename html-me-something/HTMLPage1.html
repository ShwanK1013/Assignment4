            <h1>Mustang Mach E!</h1>
            <p>Ford came out with new electrinic SUV that is direct competition with Tesla model Y! It's very bold move by Ford to make a tech heavy vehicle with reasonable price. Ford Mach E has little lower range than Model Y,
            however, a lot of EV enthusiast are excited that there is finally a vehecle that can compete with Tesla!</p>

            <h1>Mustang Mach E!</h1>

            <p>Ford finally created a tech heavy car! Although being a tech heavy can be a great feature, but they are still a step behind Tesla. Ford announced that they will publish a software update for "Hands Free drive",
            which is counter measure of Tesla's "Auto Drive". However, the tech is not out yet, it's planned to be out in 3rd quarter of 2021. Mach E with extended range battery and RWD can drive up to 305 miles! It's a unbelievable
            range! Most of company's who put their feet into EV market to compete against Tesla always felt short in range and price. Now that MSRP of Mach E California 1 is just little under 50k USD and has capability to drive up to 
            range of 305, we can finally say that there is a direct competition against Tesla. Mach E is also known for having better built quality. Tesla came to EV market in few years ago, without much of vehicle manufactor
            experience, Tesla's been criticized and accepted by consumer that quality of their car is horrible. Some even say it is a lottery to get good quality Tesla car. But, Mustang Mach E has been praised to have great built
            quality compare to Tesla! Although Mach E just came out recently, I am looking forward to see Ford's commitment and competetition against Tesla!</p>

            <h1>Price of Mustnag Mach E</h1>

            <p>
                Ford Mach E comes into EV market wiht base model MSRP of $42,000. Then, it goes up to $47,000 for premium model, $49,000 for California 1 model and $59,000 for GT model. I believe Mach E definitely has potential to 
                compete against Tesla Model Y!
